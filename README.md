Since I was a kid, videogame development has been my passion. I still remember playing on my Nintendo DS and seeing pixels come together to create a fully functioning game.
This passion has carried over to my education at University of Illinois Chicago where I have become confortable with Python, C and the C++ languages and have built many small games.
Now, as I look forward to my next semesters, I have started learning Java and have started becoming more confortable with linux.
